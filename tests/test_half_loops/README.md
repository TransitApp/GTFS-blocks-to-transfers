This example is for when loop routes are modelled as continuations between one half of the loop and another. This is currently the way loop routes such as the MetroMover Inner Loop in Miami are modelled in GTFS.

Trips 1 and 3 are the 'first half' of the loop, trips 2 and 4 are the 'second half'. The correct ordering should be 1-2-3-4 and all transfers should be in-seat transfers.
