Trip-to-trip transfers are used for both trip continuations (types 4 and 5), 
as well as to give walk times between two vehicles operating specific trips (other
types). This example shows that continuation transfers are validated and 
transformed while non-continuation transfers are left unmodified and are 
correctly propagated when trips are split.
